# Simple_alloc
A collection of simple, pure Rust memory allocators for `no_std` and embedded environments. Prioritizing simplicity and minimal dependencies, each allocator implements the [`GlobalAlloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html) trait, enabling heap allocation in `no_std` environments through Rust's [`alloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/alloc/index.html) crate.


| Memory Allocator | Status | Const Variant | 
|------------------|--------|---------------|
| [Bump Alloc](https://os.phil-opp.com/allocator-designs/#bump-allocator) | Works | yes |
| [Linked List Alloc](https://os.phil-opp.com/allocator-designs/#linked-list-allocator) | Works | no |
| [Buddy Alloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation) |  Works | no |
| [Slab Alloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_allocation) | Inprogress | no |

### Status Definitions

- **Inprogress**: Not fully implemented or finished.
- **Works**: Functionally implemented, not tested fully, odd edge cases may occur.  
- **Complete**: Fully implemented and tested.

### Const Variant

Shows if a memory allocator is available as a const variant to be initialized at compile time
instead of runtime.
